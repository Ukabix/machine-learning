General idea:

let:
y'i - projected val of yi

and

SSres (sum of squared residuals) =
SUM (yi - y'i)^2

and

SStot (stotal sum of squares) =
SUM (yi - yavg)^2

then:

R^2 = 1 - (SSres/SStot)

!How to solve:
try to get a line closest to this with regression:
lim(SSres -> 0) :  lim(R^2 -> 1)

R^2 can be negative if your SSres fits your data worse then SStot -> possible bad data quality flag and the model won't work
