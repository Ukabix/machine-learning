General idea:

for SLR and MLR:

since:
ySLR = b0 + b1*x1
yMLR = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2

then:
lim(SSres) -> min

PROBLEM:
but if:

yMLR = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + b3*x3 + bn*xn

will never decrease R^2, since the model will make a coefficient of bn*xn -> 0

p - no of regressors
n - sample size

Adj R^2 = 1 - (1- R^2) * ( (n-1) / (n-p-1) )

THIS MODEL PENALIZES INDEPENDENT VARS THAT DO NOT HELP THE MODEL.
